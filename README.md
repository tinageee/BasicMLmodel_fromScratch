# BasicMLmodel_fromScratch
This repository is dedicated to practicing basic machine learning models from scratch using Python. Here, you will find a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of fundamental machine learning algorithms without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

It provides a step-by-step explanation and visualization of the algorithms, including detailed code explanations.
